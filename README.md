#Homework 3

[1] Interpret AICc selected model from my nhlreg lasso.
Just tell some stories about what the model tells you.

[2] The gamlr run for nhlreg uses standardize=FALSE.
Why did I do this? What happens if you do standardize?

[3] Compare model selection methods for the nhlreg lasso.
Consider both IC and CV (you’ll want to create cv.nhlreg).

[4] We’ve controlled our estimates for confounding information
from team effects and special play configuration. How do things
change if we ignored this info (i.e., fit a player-only model)?
Which scheme is better (interpretability, CV, and IC)?

[+] Can you translate player Bk effects into something
comparable to classic Plus-Minus? How do things compare?
